<h1>Waffles</h1>
<img src="../images/waffles.webp">

<h2>Description</h2>
Same ingredients as pancakes, but different ratios. Waffles are crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. The textural contrast makes this dish a loveable one for the breakfast spread.
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Waffle Batter</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 1/4 cup flour</li>
    <li>2 1/2 tbsp caster sugar</li>
    <li>Pinch of cooking/kosher salt</li>
    <li>4 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>1 1/3 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp vanilla essence</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>150g unsalted butter</li>
</ul>
<h3>Topping ideas</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Maple syrup</li>
    <li>Icing sugar</li>
    <li>Strawberries, blueberries or other fruit</li>
    <li>Whipped cream</li>
    <li>Jams, marmalades, compotes</li>
    <li>Ice cream</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Whisk dry: </strong>Place the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk to combine.</li>
    <li><strong>Whisk in wet: </strong>Add milk, eggs, and vanilla. Whisk to combine. Add melted butter then whisk until lump free. The batter should be pourable but thick - slightly thinner than pancakes.</li>
    <li><strong>Recommended resting: </strong> Cover then refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight. This will create softer insides and better flavour. If you have no time to wait, proceed immediately instead to cooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Preheat </strong>a waffle maker.</li>
    <li><strong>Cooking: </strong>Use a ladle to pour batter in to just cover the iron. Don't get greedy or it will leak out the sides. Cook until golden and crisp (3-6 minutes depending on your waffle maker).</li>
    <li><strong>Serving: </strong>Transfer onto plates and serve as you go, with any toppings you like. If you are not eating immediately, put on a rack and keep warm in a preheated oven (70C) while you continue cooking.</li>
</ol>
