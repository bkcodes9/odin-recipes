<h2>Description</h2>
A classic recipe - creamy, irresistable and easy to make. Don't forget to get some crusty bread for dunking.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1.2kg pumpkin</li>
    <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled whole</li>
    <li>3 cups vegetable or chicken broth/stock</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>1/2-3/4 cup cream</li>
    <li>Fresh parsley, to garnish (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cut the pumpkin into 3cm slices. Cut the skin off and scrape seeds out. Cut the slices into 4cm chunks</li>
    <li>Place the pumpkin, onion, garlic, broth and water in a pot (liquid won't quite cover all the pumpkin). Bring to a boil, uncovered, then reduce heat and let simmer rapidly until pumpkin is tender - about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat and use a stick blender to blend until smooth.</li>
    <li>Season to taste with salt and pepper, stir through cream.</li>
    <li>Ladle soup into bowls, drizzle over a bit of cream, sprinkle with pepper and parsley if desired. Serve with crusty bread!</li>
</ol>
